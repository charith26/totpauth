# totpauth

This is a very simple example to use TOTP as a means of API Authentication. 

This is an example of generating a TOTPsecret and validating the TOTP code. 

If you want to generate a TOTP, refer [this project](https://github.com/charith26/totpgenerator)

The example is based on [Java-TOTP by samdjstevens](https://github.com/samdjstevens/java-totp)
